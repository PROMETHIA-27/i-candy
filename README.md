> A pleasant, balanced theme with a focus on contrast

This theme was chosen specifically to establish a consistent level of contrast for each color chosen, and to have contrast between syntactic elements next to each other.

Issues or PRs welcome, but the only language that I will devote significant special attention to at this time is Rust, as this is my personal theme developed specifically for it.

**Enjoy!**
